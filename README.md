# Movie Recommendation System 

This project is a comprehensive movie recommendation system that utilizes the Bag of Words technique and Cosine Similarity to suggest movies based on user preferences. The system leverages the TMDB API to fetch detailed information about movies, including directors, ratings, and actors. A user-friendly web application was built using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the system and receive personalized movie recommendations.

To enhance user engagement, a chatbot was integrated using Dialogflow, enabling users to ask questions and receive answers about movies. The chatbot, named "MovieGuru," provides an additional layer of interactivity and fun to the application.

The original version of the project also included MongoDB authentication, ensuring secure user data storage and management. However, this feature has been removed in the current version.
